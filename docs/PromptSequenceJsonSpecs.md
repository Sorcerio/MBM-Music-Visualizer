* `_v`: The version of the Prompt Sequence JSON file following [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0 specifications](https://semver.org).
* `_t`: The type of JSON file. This value will always be `promptSequence` in this case.
* `defaults`: A set of default values to use for optional values in the `sequence`.
    * `positive`: A default positive prompt to be used if one is not provided.
    * `negative`: A default negative prompt to be used if one is not provided.
* `sequence`: A list of prompt data in order from top to bottom.
    * `positive`: _(Optional)_ A positive prompt for this item.
        * If not provided, the value from `defaults` will be used.
    * `negative`: _(Optional)_ A negative prompt for this item.
        * If not provided, the value from `defaults` will be used.
    * `timecode`: _(Optional)_ The time code in seconds where a prompt should reach its max influence.
        * If not provided, `-1` will be supplied to indicate no set time code.

Note that if you would like a prompt to use _only_ the defaults, provide an empty dictionary like `{}` at the appropriate indexes in your `sequence`.

## Usage

A Prompt Sequence JSON file can be loaded by the `Prompt Sequence Loader` node.

A Prompt Sequence can also be saved from ComfyUI by using the `Prompt Seqeuence Exporter` node.

## Examples

A complete example with all optional values provided can be found above in the [Specifications](#specifications) section.
